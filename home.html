                                <li>Please consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.</li>
                                <li>If symptoms worsen or become infected, seek medical advice.</li>
                                <li>Consult a Doctor: If you suspect eczema, see a healthcare professional for diagnosis and a treatment plan. If it's severe or you experience difficulty breathing, swelling, or signs of infection, call 911.</li>
                                <li>Moisturize: Regularly apply a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer, especially after bathing, to keep your skin hydrated.</li>
                                <li>Avoid Triggers: Identify and avoid triggers such as specific soaps, detergents, fabrics, or foods that worsen your eczema.</li>
                                <li>Gentle Cleansing: Use mild, fragrance-free cleansers and lukewarm water. Pat dry gently with a soft towel.</li>
                                <li>Cotton Clothing: Wear loose, cotton clothing. Avoid wool and synthetics that can irritate your skin.</li>
                                <li>Short, Lukewarm Showers: Use lukewarm water for short showers and gentle cleansers to avoid skin irritation.</li>
                                <li>Prescription Medications: For severe cases, doctors may prescribe topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or other anti-inflammatory treatments.</li>
                                <li>Antihistamines: Over-the-counter or prescription antihistamines can help reduce itching, especially at night.</li>
                                <li>Wet Wrap Therapy: In severe cases, your doctor may recommend wet wrap therapy to reduce inflammation and lock in moisture.</li>
                                <li>Allergen Management: Identify and avoid allergens that trigger your eczema. Allergy testing may help.</li>
                                <li>Stress Management: Manage stress through techniques like deep breathing, yoga, or meditation, as stress can worsen symptoms.</li>
                                <li>Diet: Monitor your diet for potential triggers. Keeping a food diary and consulting a healthcare professional can help.</li>

                            <h1>Contact Dermatitis Management Tips</h1>
                                <ul class="tips-list">
                                    <li>Please consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.</li>
                                    <li>If you're unsure about the condition or if it's severe, please consult a healthcare professional.</li>
                                    <li>In case of a severe allergic reaction or difficulty breathing, call 911 or seek immediate medical attention.</li>
                                    <li>Identify and Avoid the Trigger: Determine the substance causing the rash and avoid further contact with it. This might include certain chemicals, plants, metals, or cosmetics.</li>
                                    <li>Cleanse the Area: Gently wash the affected area with mild soap and lukewarm water to remove any remaining irritants. Pat the skin dry with a soft towel.</li>
                                    <li>Topical Steroids: Over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams may help relieve itching and inflammation. Follow the product's instructions or consult a doctor for a stronger prescription if needed.</li>
                                    <li>Cold Compress: Apply a cold, damp compress to the affected area for 15-20 minutes to reduce itching and swelling.</li>
                                    <li>Moisturize: Keep the area well-hydrated by applying a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free moisturizer to lock in moisture. This can also help prevent further irritation.</li>
                                    <li>Antihistamines: Over-the-counter antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), can alleviate itching and discomfort.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid Scratching: Try to resist scratching, as it can worsen the rash and lead to infection. Keep your nails short and wear gloves at night if needed.</li>
                                    <li>Prescription Medications: In severe cases, a healthcare provider may prescribe stronger topical steroids, oral steroids, or other medications to manage symptoms.</li>
                                    <li>Barrier Creams: If you're exposed to irritants in your daily activities, consider using protective barrier creams to prevent contact with potential triggers.</li>
                                    <li>Allergen Testing: For chronic or recurrent cases, consider allergy testing to identify specific allergens that may be causing the contact dermatitis.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid Harsh Soaps and Detergents: Use mild, fragrance-free cleansers and detergents to reduce the risk of skin irritation.</li>
                                    <li>Clothing: Wear loose-fitting, breathable clothing made of natural fibers like cotton, and avoid tight synthetic fabrics.</li>

                                    <li>If you're unsure about the condition or if it's severe, please consult a healthcare professional.</li>
                                    <li>In the case of a severe allergic reaction, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or other severe symptoms, call 911 or seek immediate medical attention.</li>
                                    <li>Identify and Avoid Triggers: Try to determine the cause of your hives and avoid any known allergens or triggers. Common triggers can include certain foods, medications, insect stings, and allergens.</li>
                                    <li>Over-the-Counter Antihistamines: Non-prescription antihistamines, such as cetirizine (Zyrtec) or loratadine (Claritin), can help relieve itching and reduce hives. Follow the recommended dosing instructions.</li>
                                    <li>Prescription Medication: In severe cases or when over-the-counter antihistamines are not effective, your healthcare provider may prescribe stronger antihistamines, corticosteroids, or other medications to manage symptoms.</li>
                                    <li>Cool Compresses: Applying cold, damp compresses to the affected areas can help soothe itching and reduce inflammation.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid Hot Water: When bathing or showering, use lukewarm water rather than hot water, which can exacerbate hives.</li>
                                    <li>Loose Clothing: Wear loose-fitting, breathable clothing made from natural fibers like cotton to prevent friction and irritation.</li>
                                    <li>Keep a Symptom Diary: Record when hives occur and what you were doing or eating before they appeared. This can help identify triggers.</li>
                                    <li>Stress Management: Stress can sometimes exacerbate hives. Practice stress-reduction techniques such as deep breathing, yoga, or meditation.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid Alcohol and Certain Foods: Some people with hives find that alcohol, certain foods (like spicy foods and high histamine foods), and caffeine can worsen symptoms. Consider avoiding these triggers.</li>
                                    <li>Consult an Allergist: If hives are recurrent or chronic, consulting an allergist can help identify specific triggers through allergy testing.</li>
